\section{Specification}

There were several guidelines and requirements when designing the autonomous balancing robot.
The system must:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Autonomously move through a maze without crossing an illuminated line.
    \item Autonomously survey the layout of the maze and produce a map of the discovered layout, overlaid with the position of the robot and the shortest path through the maze.
    \item Balance on two wheels.
\end{enumerate}


The autonomous balancing robot is assessed in the following ways.
The system must be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reliable and able to complete its task without human intervention.
    \item Robustly and efficiently constructed.
    \item Coded for:
          \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
              \item Usability
              \item Testability
              \item Maintainability
              \item Scalability
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}



Restrictions are also imposed on the project in the following ways.
The permitted means of locating the robot within the maze are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dead-reckoning based on accelerometer, gyroscope and wheel revolution counting.
    \item Optical detection of the maze markings and up to three illuminated beacons by the robot.
    \item Illuminated beacons shall be powered by a specified PV-array emulator and provided energy conversion modules.
    \item The robot will use the provided FPGA-based camera system
\end{enumerate}

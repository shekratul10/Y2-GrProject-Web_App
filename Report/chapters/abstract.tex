\section{Abstract}

A balancing robot is required to navigate a maze autonomously. The arena is coloured black and surrounded by black curtains. Light strips are laid out on the arena that creates a maze.
A prototype of the design should be produced and assessed in the arena based on the time it takes to solve the maze.

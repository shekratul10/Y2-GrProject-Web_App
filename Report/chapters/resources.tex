\section{Resources}
To start off the project, various components were provided and some were given as time progress. Below is the record of the components given. (Please type descriptions of each of the components)
FPGA board (FPGA Max DE-10 Lite)
Camera module (D8M)
WiFi microcontroller (ESP32)
Inertial measurement unit (MPU6050)
Stepper motors and drivers (NEMA-17 Stepper motors and A4988 Stepper Motor Drivers)
\begin{enumerate}[label=--]
    \item Built for precision.
    \item Excellent Torque at low speed.
    \item Constantly drawing max current.
    \item Causing motor and driver circuits to build more heat. So worse for battery life.

\end{enumerate}
